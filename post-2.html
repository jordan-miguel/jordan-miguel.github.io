                        <p>If you work in tech you will almost certainly have come across the HTTP vs HTTPS issue. Hopefully you haven't had to manually convert
                             all instances of HTTP to HTTPS in your codebase (raises hand‚úãüèæ)
                            <br><br>
                            Unfortunately I was given the exciting task of doing this recently, whilst having my plate already full - but such is life.
                            <br><br>
                            I want to briefly go over the difference between HTTP and HTTPS for those who are interested.

                        <p>
                            Firstly, the acronym stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>t</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol. Essentially HTTP allows an internet application to establish and improve
                            the client-server communication between shared information systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In layman terms, your browser sends a HTTP request to the web server (a could computer for example). The server receives this request and
                            if all is well, executes an application. It then returns the execution to the client. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you click on a Youtube video, you are sending a request to the Youtube server, this server executes your request and plays the video - you
                            are the client.
                            <br><br>
                            Simple, right?

                           This stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol <b>Secure</b>. You're probably thinking, secure is better - and you are completely right.
                           <br>
                           A HTTPs request follows the same flow as we've just described above in HTTP. There is one <b>major difference</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unlike a HTTP request, HTTPS requests secure the flow of information between client and server via <i>encryption</i>.
                            Therefore this information cannot be intercepted and used in a malicious way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Up until a few years ago HTTP was widely used and accepted as the norm, however web browsers place the integrity and confidentiality of data
                            between client and server at the forefront of their concerns. 
                            <br>
                            If you're using chrome, visit a site without a HTTPs protocol, to do this simply type 'http:' into the search bar and select the first site
                            that shows. You should see the below.

                        <p>
                            If you're working solely, or in a large team with a huge codebase you can check that you're conforming to HTTPs protocol best practices by using
                            this quick tip.
                            <br>
                            Hit CMD+F or CTRL+F and search for any instances of 'http:/' - simply replace all with 'https:/' or one by one depending on your needs.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Note:</b> If you are working in a large team that uses version control I would advise against doing this in the Master branch!
                        </p>
